# Numerical Simulations of the Heating of a Crystal

This simulation produces the spatial and time-dependent heat profiles of a rectangular cut crystal, with one end connected to a bath, and the other irradiated by a laser.

The material is currently silicon. The properties of the material can be changed to your choosing, however. The geometry of the crystal is also a free parameter, as are the temperature and laser power of the sample.
